# Wiimote
Turn any screen into a touchscreen using Python, an infrared pen, and a Wii Remote.

Based on and inspired by Johnny Lee's project at http://johnnylee.net/projects/wii/. Unfortunately, the project uses an outdated version of java, so I rebuilt the project using Python, using the package cwiid at https://pypi.org/project/cwiid/.
